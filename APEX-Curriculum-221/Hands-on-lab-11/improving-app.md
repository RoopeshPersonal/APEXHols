## Task 2: Set Pages to Public
Your customers don't need to log in the app to shop the products, so let's set the following pages as public:
- Page 19: Products
- Page 15: Order Information
- Page 16: Shopping Cart
- Page 17: Add to Cart

Follow these steps for the four listed pages:

1. From the runtime application, navigate to the **Products** page.

    In the Developer Toolbar click **Edit Page 19**.

    ![](./images/navigate-to-page19.png " ")

2. Within Page Designer, in the Rendering tree (left pane), navigate to  **Page 19: Products**.

    In the Property Editor (right pane), apply the following change:
    - Under Security section:
        - For Authentication - select **Page Is Public**  

      ![](./images/edit-page19.png " ")

3. Click **Save**.

4. Navigate to Page Finder and select **Page 15** from Dialog Page.

    ![](./images/navigate-to-page-finder.png " ")
    
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for **Page 16: Shopping Cart** and **Page 17: Add to Cart**.

## Task 3: Clean the Navigation Menu
Since the home page is the Products page and this is a public access page, we do not need a navigation menu.
In this task, you will turn off displaying the navigation menu.

1. Within Page Designer, click the Shared Components icon at the top right.

   Alternatively, if you are in the App Builder, click Shared Components.

3. Click **Navigation Menu**.

4. Set Display Navigation to **Off**.
